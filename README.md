# Interactive-Wind-Turbine
I integrated sound to enhance the immersive experience of my [Interactive Wind Turbine sketch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt3YLawaaRM), which is done using the Minim library â€” a popular library for audio processing in Processing sketches. The first line in the code includes the Minim library. In the setup() function, two AudioPlayer objects are created to handle the wind turbine sound and the background sound. The background sound is set to loop continuously. In the draw() function, the wind sound is controlled based on the wind intensity. The sound starts playing when the wind intensity is above a certain threshold (0.20 in this case). The background sound creates an ambient atmosphere, while the wind sound provides audio feedback corresponding to the wind intensity, making the interaction feel more engaging and realistic.

Instead of using a sine wave, I used Perlin noise, changed the color to a shade of brown, and decreased the opacity for slight transparency over the grass in the JPG to create a more visually engaging, natural-looking grass plain. Perlin noise generates smooth, continuous random values, which can create more organic terrain. The noise() function is part of Processing's built-in functionality for generating Perlin noise, which is a gradient noise function often used in graphics for creating smooth randomness, such as terrain generation, cloud patterns, and more. It produces values that appear more natural than random noise, with a continuous flow. The combination of the x position and the frameCount means that as the sketch runs, the noise values will change gradually, simulating the effect of a breezy grass plain that subtly move or shift over time. The noise value is then scaled (by multiplying with 20 in this case) to control the amplitude of the grass plain, allowing it to rise and fall smoothly, which helps avoid the abruptness that might come from using random noise.

I also included PNG files for the clouds with added perlin noise to create a realistic and engaging environment that visually represents wind dynamics. Perlin noise is used to generate smooth, natural movements for clouds, enhancing their visual appeal and mimicking real-life behavior. The cloud images are drawn with transparency, allowing them to blend seamlessly into the background and contribute to the atmospheric feel. I used the tint() function to set transparency for both PNG files as well to add a layer of visual interest and complexity to the scene.

Finding proper images was the primary challenge I encountered. For the background, I searched the NREL.gov Image Gallery to find a photo to incorporate the existing interactive wind turbine simulation elements into its scene. I flipped the image canvas horizontally in Photoshop to maintain the position of the wind turbine. I wanted more realistic clouds, so I used Photoshop's Generative AI tool to create a scene with stratus clouds. After a few prompts, it generated an image that I could extract a stratus cloud from and place it on a transparent canvas, which I exported as a PNG.
